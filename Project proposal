@ PROJECT IDEA 1 @

%%  Smart Air Quality Monitoring & Control System  $$
* Concept: 
A system designed to monitor indoor air quality and automatically regulate ventilation and purification to ensure a healthy environment.

* Sensors:
Air quality sensor (MQ-135) → Detects CO₂ and harmful gases
Temperature & humidity sensor (DHT22) → Monitors environmental conditions
Light sensor (LDR) → Adjusts ventilation based on ambient light levels

* Actuators:
Exhaust fan → Turns ON when CO₂ levels are high
Air purifier → Activates when pollutants exceed safe levels

* Extra Feature:
Displays real-time air quality trends

Useful for homes, offices, and labs
Provides a combination of safety, automation, and environmental control

$$  Smart Fish Tank Management System  $$
* Concept:
An automated system to monitor and regulate various conditions in a fish tank to create the optimal environment for aquatic life.

* Sensors:
pH sensor → Monitors water acidity for safe aquatic conditions
Temperature sensor (DS18B20) → Ensures optimal water temperature
Water level sensor → Detects when the water level is too low

* Actuators:
Water pump → Adds fresh water when the level drops
Heater → Activates if the water temperature falls below the set range

* Extra Feature:
LED lighting control (3-step brightness adjustment)
Displays water quality data in real-time

Perfect for aquarium enthusiasts
Uses multiple sensors and actuators in a real-world application

$$  Smart Study Desk for Students  $$
* Concept:
A desk that adjusts lighting, reminds students to take breaks, and helps reduce distractions automatically, enhancing productivity.

* Sensors:
Light sensor (LDR) → Adjusts LED brightness according to ambient light
Proximity sensor → Detects the presence of a user at the desk
Noise sensor → Monitors sound levels to detect distractions

* Actuators:
LED strip with brightness control → Adjusts based on ambient light levels
Buzzer/Vibration motor → Reminds the user to take a break when needed

* Extra Feature:
LabVIEW Study Timer → Tracks focus time and break intervals
Phone usage detection (via Bluetooth module) → Alerts if a phone is being used during study time

Unique and student-friendly
Blends automation with productivity tracking
